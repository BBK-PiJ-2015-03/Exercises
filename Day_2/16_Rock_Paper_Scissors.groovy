//Taskk
//Write a program that reads 2 characters from either the keyboard or a file. The characters are either PP, PR, PS, RP,
//RR, RS, SP, SR, or SS. They correspond to the selections made by 2 players playing the game of rock-paper-scissors.
//Make the program accept inputs until one playerâ€™s score is more than 3 points ahead of the other.
//Hint: remember that you can use .substring() to get the elements of a String.
